Power Of Numbers

Given a number n, find the value of n raised to the power of its own reverse.

Note: The result will always fit into a 32-bit signed integer.

Examples:

Input: n = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The reverse of 2 is 2, and 22 = 4.
Input: n = 10
Output: 10
Explanation: The reverse of 10 is 1 (leading zero is discarded), and 101 = 10.
Input: n = 3
Output: 27
Explanation: The reverse of 3 is 3, and 33 = 27.
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10

solution:

//recursion

class Solution 
{
    public int reverseExponentiation(int n) 
    {
        int rev=0;
        int t=n;
        while(t>0){
            rev=rev*10+t%10;
            t/=10;
        }
        return power(n,rev,n);
    }
    public int power(int n,int p,int t)
    {
        if(p==1){
            return n;
        }
        return power((n*t),p-1,t);
    }
}
